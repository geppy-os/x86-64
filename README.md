# Description

It's x86-64 OS in its very early stages. Complete memory allocations functions are not even finished.

# Instalaltion

 Compile "geppy.asm" with FASM (found at http://flatassembler.net/download.php).
 FASM is available for Windows and Linux.

You need ready to use bootable disk/usb/floppy/whatever that can run resulted after compiling file. There are tons of options here so instructions are skipped.

# License

Well, It's GPL v1.
Will change if anyone interested in active help.
